The Prize Collecting Traveling Sales Problem (PCTSP) is a known NP-Hard problem. Since no efficent polynomail time solution exists for the problem, there are two main camps of solutions to approximate the optimal; heuristics like shortest-path or more complicated AI models such as genetic algorithims or re-enforcement learning algorithms. 

This projects presents a single agent Q-Learning re-enforcement learning algorithm which out-preforms the greedy shortest-path heuristic as well as other multi-agent Q-learning algorithms for the PCTSP.
