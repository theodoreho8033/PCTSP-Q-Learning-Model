A schoool project tackling the Prize Collecting Traveling Sales Problem (PCTSP), a known NP-hard problem. Our proposed solution to the PCTSP is a single agent reinforcement learning Q-Learning algorithm adapted from a multi agent reinforcement learning
algorithm published from the California State Univeristy.

Our algorithm obtained a 5% increase in path-length from the shortest-path heuristic.
